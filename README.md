Currently, I'm a master degree student at <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64522272/111808150-c725db00-88e4-11eb-99b5-ee3a0b7c7dff.png" width="50">  
I'm trying to find the nature of things üå± by using Data Science and Machine Learning with Engineering approaches and curiosity  
On the way to becoming real a Data Scientist!
