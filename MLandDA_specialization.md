### Machine Learning and Data Analysis Specialization

Machine Learning and Data Analysis Specialization is open online course available on Coursera platform. Authors are specialysts from Yandex (few of them Ex Yandex)
and teachers from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.

This specialization consist of 6 courses.

The first course covers the basic concept of python programming for Data Science, matrix decompositions, optimizations, and probability theory.

The Second course covers topic of supervised learning. In this course in mathematic details was considered such aspects as: Gradient Descent,
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Regularization technics for linear models, Cross-validation and hold out method to estimate the quality of a model,
Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 score, Polinominal regression, Grid Search, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, MLE to linear models, decision tree model,
Splitting criteria for decision trees, Random forest, Gradient Boosting and how to prevent it from overfitting. *Second course gives an excellent starting point
to move towards a real-world task. For homework, there was a lot of tasks where a model should be implemented from scratch or verify quality of the model* 

The third course covers a topic of clustering and dimensionality reduction. There also in details was about: K-means, EM algorithm, Agglomerative clustering,
SVD, PCA, Non-negative matrix factorization, Feature selection, Multidimensional scaling, t-SNE, parametric and non-parametric density estimation.

The fourth course covers statistics. In course was described: Confidence intervals, Confidence intervals based on bootstrap, hypothesis testing,
p-value, A lot of different criteria for hypothesis testing, Pearson and Spearman Correlations, Matthews and Cramer correlation coefficients, Multiple comparisons problem. 
*This course gives enough basis to gain skills in analytics and perform quality EDA*

The fifth course related to Time Series, Computer Vision, NLP, and Rankng tasks.

The sixth course was dedicated to the project. I chose a project about determining a specific person from a lot of different logs through behavior patterns on the Web.
It was the Kaggle competition with a pretty tricky solution with the definition of session window in terms of time and with time-series cross-validation.
