This course was provided by employees of the Risk Modelling department of Sberbank. The course was based on the personal experience of the authors and also 
allowed during the lectures to ask various questions of interest that might arise, which the students often used.

During the course, six homework assignments of varying complexity were submitted.
Homework was submitted to GitHub through the pull request to our repository through the review of the authors.
It allowed becoming freer to use git and a great opportunity to share the code.

The first three homework papers were devoted to an introduction to computing using Pytorch and Tensorflow.
The fourth homework was about reading, implementing from scratch, and applying the DeepFM architecture to a dataset.
DeepFM is quite a good architecture of a neural network for use on sparse data.
The fifth work was quite similar to the fourth. 
There was necessary to implement the TabNet architecture, which turned out to be a rather interesting task that can be solved quite nicely using Pytorch.
I also wrapped this task in scripts and wrote a launch using the config file with separate logging.
The sixth work was more creative. It was necessary to classify fraudulent users by the sequence of their transactions.
Any model could be used. I applied a conventional multilayer LSTM model and a convolutional neural network on sequences.
Interestingly enough, the convolutional neural network gave the best result. The code has also been wrapped in scripts and is run using configs.

In general, this is a cool course for gaining skills in writing architectures from articles, learning new technologies, as well as optimization methods, 
and creating stable models in the field of Risks.
